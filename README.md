# NFL Player App

#### Assignment
1) Build a user interface in ReactJS with a navbar and two different tabs: 'Player Data' and 'Player Stats'
2) One tab should display a table with all of the players in the 'players' table and the associated columns (name, height, age, etc)
3) A second tab should have two visuals associated with the player stats in the 'player_stats' table. You can choose the statistic and visual that you want to show.
4) Build an API to read the data from the database above.

#### GitHub and Directions
1) Fork this repo and code up your solution for review by the Summit team.
2) The app does NOT need to be hosted anywhere. We will simply run the frontend and API locally to see your app.
3) Please email Scott and Quan by Sunday at 10:00pm with your completed assignment (scott.senkier@summitllc.us and quan.nguyen@summitllc.us).
4) We will look at your forked repo and get back to you if we have any questions.
